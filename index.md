# Hi there!

I'm Florian and welcome to my page ðŸ˜€

I'm a PhD student working in [Numerical Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_relativity)
and I like contributing to open source projects,
in particular to the [Julia Programming Language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)
and projects surrounding it.
